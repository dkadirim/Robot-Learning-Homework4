# Robot-Learning-Homework4

src folder has the game and 2,3 grid python files. 
To play the game, run the main python file.

2Grid Jupyter Notebook has the implementation of the game with a random agent and with the Neural Network(CMAC).
3Grid Jupyter Notebook has the implementation of the game with a random agent and with the Neural Network(CMAC).

For the results of the implementation of Q learning and Function approximation by Neural Network(CMAC) for 2,3 Grid is shown in the report.
